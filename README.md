# Neuro-sama Among Us Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to allow Neuro-sama, the AI VTuber, to play Among Us.

## About

The plan is to first allow this plugin to record data from the game, which will then be used to train a neural network which Neuro will use.

## How to run

- Install BepInEx [https://docs.reactor.gg/quick_start/install_bepinex](https://docs.reactor.gg/quick_start/install_bepinex)
- Install Reactor [https://docs.reactor.gg/quick_start/install_reactor](https://docs.reactor.gg/quick_start/install_reactor)
- Ensure you have the .NET 6.0 SDK [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- Build the plugin using an IDE of your choice, I'm using Visual Studio
- Add the built Neuro.dll to your plugins folder (I'd recommend adding `<OutputPath>PATH_TO_AMONG_US_FOLDER\Among Us\BepInEx\plugins</OutputPath>` to the PropertyGroup section of the [Neuro.csproj](Neuro/Neuro.csproj) file) 
- Run Among Us
